</p><h2 id="dispute-resolution">19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

<h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
<p>
    If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.
    <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”),
    both of which are available at the <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank">American Arbitration Association (AAA)</a> website.
</p>
<p>
    Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
    The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.
    The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
</p>
<p>
    Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
</p>
<p>
    If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the courts located in Amsterdam, Netherlands,
    and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such courts.
</p>
<p>
    Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
</p>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
    The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>No arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding.</li>
    <li>There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures.</li>
    <li>There is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
<p>
    The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party.</li>
    <li>Any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use.</li>
